# To whoever is marking this.

For some reason this README is the only page I can get deployed (The other routes give 404). I spent a lot of time trying to get react to deploy on both github pages and netlify to no avail. I followed the guides the professor provided, but no matter what I tried, I could not get my site to deploy. I sent an email to the TA explaining my issue and handed in my report before the due date. I would not like to lose marks over not having my website viewed. Is there any chance you can clone the project and run the react app locally using `npm start` to view my site? This would be very much appreciated.
